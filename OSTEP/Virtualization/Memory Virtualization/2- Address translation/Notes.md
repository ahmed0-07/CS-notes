- With address translation, the OS can control each and every memory access from a process, ensuring the accesses stay within the bounds of the address space.
- The process has no idea its memory references are being translated, making for a wonderful illusion.

#  Dynamic Relocation (Base & Bounds)

- Base-and-bounds virtualization is quite efficient, as only a little more hardware logic is required to add a base register to the virtual address and check that the address generated by the process is in bounds.
- Base-and-bounds also offers protection; the OS and hardware combine to ensure no process can generate memory references outside its own address space.
