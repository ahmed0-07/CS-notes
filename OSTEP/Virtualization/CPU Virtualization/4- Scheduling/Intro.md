# Scheduling Metrics

>A metric is just something that we use to measure something.

### 1- Turnaround time

>The turnaround time of a job is defined as the time at which the job completes minus the time at which the job arrived in the system.

### 2- Response Time

>We define response time as the time from when the job arrives in a system to the first time it is runs

# Scheduling Algorithms

### 1- First In, First Out (FIFO)

### 2- Shortest Job First (SJF)

### 3- Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)

### 4- Round Robin
